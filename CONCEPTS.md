# Concepts

Shared domain vocabulary for this project — entities, named processes, and status concepts with project-specific meaning. Seeded with core domain vocabulary, then accretes as ce-compound and ce-compound-refresh process learnings; direct edits are fine. Glossary only, not a spec or catch-all.

## Google Photos Import

### Picker Session
A short-lived, server-brokered handle representing one in-progress photo selection through Google's own Photos Picker UI. The app creates a Picker Session, the user picks photos inside Google's hosted picker, and the app polls the session until it reports the selection is ready, then fetches the selected items and discards the session.

A Picker Session has an expiry and a polling interval set by Google, not the app. Once its selected items have been fetched, the app is responsible for explicitly deleting it — the app never relies on Google to clean it up automatically.

### Media Item
A single photo the user selected inside a Picker Session, described by Google (filename, MIME type, capture metadata, and a temporary download URL) but not yet downloaded into the app. A Picker Session yields zero or more Media Items once the user's selection is complete.
